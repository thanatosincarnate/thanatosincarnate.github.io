title: Slim Themes for Small Screens

<div class="message">
I've finally moved my blog from Google to something that works without javascript and is much faster - <a href="https://github.com/poole/poole">Poole</a>, an easy to set up solution using Jekyll and Github. Looks great so far! From now on, there's no comment section - it was rarely used and I share my content mostly on <a href="https://pod.geraspora.de/u/thanatosincarnate">my Diaspora account</a> anyway, so feel free to comment over there or just <a href="mailto:thanatosincarnate@openmailbox.org">email me</a>.

On recent posts, I have lamented how new GUI development is rather geared towards full HD screens, i.e. 1920x1080 resolution, or even 4K displays. If you're like me, however, you won't give up on your hardware with a lower screen resolution just because certain developers won't consider them. In fact, if you stick to mostly GTK2 or QT programmes and don't depend too much on GTK3, chances are lower resolutions can be used well for production systems. Here are my tips, some more obvious than others, on how to increase screen real estate:

## The more obvious ones

I'll be working with traditional desktop metaphors, as UIs such as Gnome, Unity etc. require a more hands on approach with theming. My machine has an 1366x768 resolution and runs Xfce, so for a slimmer look, I trim the following setings:

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Panel height ("Row size" on Xfce)</td>
      <td>18</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Font and size</td>
      <td>Droid Sans 8; Ubuntu Mono 10 for consoles</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>DPI</td>
      <td>96</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Themes

It's easy to find some older GTK2 themes that have been slimmed down. The most popular used to be Clearlooks Compact. If you look over the creator's site, I
