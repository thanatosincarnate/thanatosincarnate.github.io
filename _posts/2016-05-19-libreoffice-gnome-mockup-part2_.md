title: Quick Fix - LibreOffice Gnome Mockup - Part 2 
---

This is my second attempt at a Gnome 3 themed mockup for LibreOffice. Read about my initial idea [here](http://thanatosincarnate.github.io/2015/08/28/libreoffice-gnome-mockup/ "LibreOffice Gnome Mockup - Part 1"). This time, I've created a startpage and a Writer mockup.

My work is public domain in case anyone wants to hack at it. The extra icons used are from the Adwaita icon theme in Gnome 3.18 (Fedora Workstation 23).
